üîç Problem Statement:
The Minimum Cost Flow Problem is a classic issue in the field of network optimization, focusing on finding the most cost-effective way to transport commodities across a network. This problem is critical in various applications, including transportation planning, logistics, telecommunications, and supply chain management. It involves determining the optimal flow of goods through a network such that the total transportation cost is minimized while satisfying specific supply and demand constraints at various nodes.

üßÆ Mathematical Formulation:
This section of the notebook delves into the mathematical underpinnings of the MCFP. It includes:

Variables and Parameters: Definitions for network nodes, arcs, capacities, and costs.
Objective Function: The goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation across the network.
Constraints:
Supply and demand constraints at each node.
Flow conservation constraints ensuring that the amount of flow into a node equals the flow out of it.
Capacity constraints on each arc in the network.
The formulation is presented in a step-by-step manner, making it accessible even to those new to the topic.

üí° Usage Instructions:
To make the most out of this notebook:

Installation: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with Python and necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Execution: Follow the notebook cell by cell to understand the flow of concepts, methodologies, and solution strategies.
Experimentation: You are encouraged to modify the parameters, try different data sets, and observe the impact on the solutions to get a hands-on understanding of the MCFP.
